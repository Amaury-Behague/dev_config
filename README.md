# Amaury's Dev Config

This repo contains the configuration for my dev environment, in a portable way (on Unix-based machines at least).
The goal is to be ready to code on any machine in a matter of minutes, using only a terminal and an internet
connection.

The structure of the repository is intended to be able to be pasted in the home of a new user.

## NeoVim (nvim)

The config sits in `.config/nvim` and is comprised of lua files.
Some parts may be uncommented once the necessary manual installs are done.
